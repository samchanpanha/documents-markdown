**Microservices are the core of a large architecture, and I will focus on the details of the microservices deployment architecture @ mikechen**

**Multi-instance deployment of microservices**

Deploy multiple **physical machines** , virtual machines , or cloud instances with multiple copies （ instances ） of the same microservice .

Typically through **load balancers** to distribute traffic to improve availability and performance .

**For example:** `<span leaf="" class="js_darkmode__text__43">user-service</span>`Deploy 3 instances, `<span leaf="" class="js_darkmode__text__46">order-service</span>`Deploy 2 instances.

**Pros:**

**Resource utilization is high, with service instances sharing server and operating system resources.**

**The deployment and startup speed are fast, and you can start right after copying the service file.**

**Cons:**

**Service isolation is inadequate, and a single instance exception may affect other instances on the same host machine.**

**Application scenario:**

**Traditional single-host multi-service instance deployments are appropriate when the scale is small.**

**Containerized deployment of microservices**

**This is deployed using container technologies such as Docker and is the gateway to cloud native.**

Encapsulate each microservice into a container image （ **Docker Image** ），Run independently in a container.

**Environments, dependencies, and applications are packaged together to "build once, run everywhere."**

**Pros:**

**Containers provide process-level isolation, with fine resource constraints (CPU, memory, IO).**

**High portability, consistent environment, and simplified deployment.**

**Cons:**

**Additional packaged container mirrors are needed to increase build complexity.**

**Application scenario:**

**Resource management and isolation requirements are high, and agile delivery and continuous integration are pursued.**

**Fast elastic scaling, high availability demand scenarios.**

**Microservices Serverless Deployment**

**This is the direction of cloud-native architecture, which will push operational work to the extreme and achieve true on-demand paying.**

**Developers only need to write business logic and deploy to serverless platforms (such as AWS Lambda, Alibaba Cloud Computing, KNative).**

**It automatically completes resource allocation, startup, expansion, billing and logoff.**

**Pros:**

**No need to manage the underlying server and no operation.**

**By charging for calls, the waste of idle resources can be greatly reduced.**

**Cons:**

**Part of the business logic is complex and difficult to break down into functions.**

**Platform vendors lock in risk.**

**Application scenario:**

**Lightweight microservices with short life cycles.**

**Innovative projects with a limited budget and a desire to reduce operating costs.**

**Microservice container orchestration deployment**

**This is the current Kubernetes (K8S), as represented by the mainstream, and mature enterprise-class microservices deployment solution.**

**It solved the operational difficulties of containerized deployment and unified management of container scheduling, scaling, disaster tolerance and renewal.**

**Pros:**

**Automated scheduling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities.**

**Supports service discovery, rolling upgrades and elastic scaling.**

**Unified management of cluster resources improves cluster utilization.**

**Cons:**

**The learning curve is steep and the deployment and operational complexity is high.**

**Stable infrastructure support is needed.**

**Application scenario:**

**Large-scale microservices cluster production environments;**

**Enterprise-class systems that require continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI / CD) and high availability;**

**Dynamic resource management and elastic scaling scenarios.**
